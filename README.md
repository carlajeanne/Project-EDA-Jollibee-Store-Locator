# Project-EDA-Jollibee-Store-Locator

## Overview
Jollibee is a go-to fast-food chain and a staple for most Filipinos. They offer a Filipino style spaghetti and fried chicken that have become a favorite comfort food for all Filipinos. We celebrate every milestone in Jollibee may it be birthdays, graduations, meetings and even on simple days. Which is why there are countless of Jollibee stores within the Philippines. However, there are still some certain locations that do not have access to a Jollibee store, or it can be not enough to cater all citizens within that city.

This Project focuses on the retail food industry, specifically the fast-food sector in the Philippines. This laboratory will include analyzing data from Jollibee store locations and the services they offer to introduce opportunities for people that wanted to venture in franchising a Jollibee store.
